Released on Friday, December 23rd, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

------------
- /players command now only works up to 4. Before it worked up to 8, even though their could only be 4 human players total.

4.2.0 Changes:
------------
- Updated Mod to 1.13d (Primarily the .dlls)
- Added Modding folder with useful information for moders. 
* Moders should download the older versions (Modder's Edition) if they want some extra tools (Spreadsheets for calculating percentages of game items, etc).
- Skill timers are back to normal
- UniqueItems.txt is back to normal (Some uniques are not available on non-ladder, doesn't affect Single Player people).
- Teleport cannot be used in town anymore.

4.1 Changes:
------------
- Created a brand new TreasureClassEx.txt (Drop Rates)

- Drop ratios (Unique/Set/Rare/Magic) have been significantly improved (ItemRatio.txt)

- Akara now sells Token of Absolution (Misc.txt)

- Since the game caders to High Resistances vs Immunities, FE/CE/LE/Stoneskin/Magic Resistance/Spectral Hit/Poison Hit have been removed from the game (SuperUniques.txt, MonUMod.txt)

4.0 Changes:
-------------
- Returned the Experience table to the regular 1.13 ones (The Level is still 100, and you still receive 100% of experience).
- Rune drop rates have been further balanced

3.9F Changes:
-------------
- Continued to balance drops
- Skill delays have been removed again
- The game is geared towards higher resistances rather than immunities. Max resistance for normal monster = 99. SuperUniques can go over.
- Paladin auras have been removed from left hand because they wouldn't activate.
- Experience cap has increased from 2,000,000,000 to 3,500,000,000.
Other:
- There will now only be one .zip file that contains both regular and modder's files.
- Some files have been removed. D2Mods.com (PhrozenKeep) has all the information you need to mod.

3.8F Changes:
--------------
In this patch I relooked at the mod completely and decided to bring it even more back to the normal Diablo experience.

- Skill delays are back to normal.
- Immunities are back in the game but are maxed at 100% so that they can be broken.
- Redid the Experience Table again and increased the experience cap from 1,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. This affects all the values going down.
- Monster experience throughout the entire game has increased to compensate for the new experience table.
- In memory of Diablo 1, the maximum number of players in a game can only be 4. So make sure to pick your members wisely. In Single Player, you can still use the /players command up to 8.
- The number of Cows in the Moo Moo Farm are back to normal.
- Throwing weapons stack size have been increased by 5x.

3.71F Changes:
--------------
- Included my the new version of my Experience Generator
- Regerated the Experience Table with the Experience Generator so it's closer to my original vision.

3.7F Changes:
-------------
- Drop table has been heavily improved. You will now find a wider range of items. Before, the drops would be stuck around a specific point (consequetive Artic Furs dropping)
- Gold will no longer drop. Most people probably pick up items and sell them rather than pick up 1 or 2 pieces of gold.
- Runes are slightly harder to find
- You can now redo the Cow Level even if you kill the king.
- The recipe to make the Cow Level is now just a Tome of Town Portal.
- Brand new Experience table
- All skill delays have been removed.
- You can now use Teleport, Thunder Storm, Battle Orders, Battle Command, and Shout in town.

3.6F Changes:
-------------
- Completely new experience table. The maximum level is now 100.
* I tried to keep the experience linear, than exponential. The maximum experience is 1,000,000,000 = Lvl 100.
* There is an Experience Table spreadsheet included in the archive for any future modders.

3.5F Changes:
-------------
- Brand new drop system again, a lot of things were equalized, and so you have a much better chance of finding top level items and runes. Chests, Bosses, Mini-Bosses, Dead bodies also have improved with the new system.
- Difficulty penalties have been restored. So don't die, and boost up your resistances!

3.0F Changes:
-------------
- Fixed a Blizzard typo that gave Smith and Griswold in Nightmare, Hell unique drops instead of Nightmare ones.

- Scrapped the previous drop rates and made a completely new one with a different algorithm in handling calculations (not a hardcoded algorithm, but a self-algorithm). The new drop rates are based on the Blizzard drop rates, and are better than the vanilla ones.

- Everything in the game will ALWAYS drop something. 

- Added the ladder runewords to Single Player again. I forgot to include the required file in the previous releases.

- Added the rune downgrade system back into the game.

- (Spreadsheet) Added polished versions of my DropRate.ods and RuneDropRate.ods spreadsheets to the zip for your convenience and viewing. This also helps future mod makers with their own mods, or if they want to build upon my mod.

- (Spreadsheet) Added MonStats_Level.ods spreadsheet to the zip for your convenience and viewing. This also helps future mod makers with their own mods, or if they want to build upon my mod.

2.5F Changes:
-------------
- Fixed the super unique immunity bug. Some super uniques still had immunities when spawning with FE/CE/LE/MR/Physical Resistance (Stoneskin). These modifiers have now been disabled from the game.

- Continued to improve and balance drop rates through out the entire game

- You can now find Essenses in all difficulties (For Respec/Token of Absolution - Andy, Meph, Diablo, Baal)

2.01F Changes:
--------------
- All skills can now be used either on left or right hand.

2.00F Changes:
--------------
- All cube recipes are now completely unlocked (including tempered recipes).

- Rune downgrade recipes have been removed.

- All uniques are now enabled and available on non-ladder (Doesn't really affect Single Player/TCP-IP since you already have them)

- Difficulty penalties are now removed (Resistance, Exp, Life/Mana, Static Field)

- Drop rates for the entire game have been re-done and improved. 
This doesn't mean you are going to find better item quality types (unique,set,rare,magic). It just means you have a better chance to a better item than junk.
The new drop rates also encourage players to kill regular monsters, and open chests more often to find items. A player shouldn't be forced to MF in order to find items. The items will also help you along your adventure.

- Resistances for each difficulty has been set back to their respective values, but the maximum resistance in the game is now 75%. This puts the monsters and the characters at an even playing field.
Also note, that your pets also have a maximum of 75% unless you increase it somehow. Fire Golem normally has 100% resistance, now it only has 75%, etc.

Changes/Enhancements to Vanilla Diablo II 1.13C - 1.00F:
------------------------------------------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player & TCP/IP

- Immunities in all difficulties are now the same as Normal.
This permits people to actually be able to solo Hell without HAVING to make horrible dual builds. This also lets you experiment with other build styles as well.

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- All recipes are now unlocked for non-ladder players as well. (Doesn't really affect anyone since this is for SP & TCP/IP.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style which means that they are the same size as normal. Small and comfortable.

- Changed cows level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher iLvl drops.
The 1.10+ cows already gave you more experience than 1.09 cows, so me increasing the level requirement, will actually give you 9785 more experience per kill. 
The only reason I can see from the slowing down of hell cows for leveling in 1.10+ is that the exp ratio was nerfed.

- You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens (like pre 1.10)

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II for Single Player - TCP/IP purposes ONLY

- Rune drop rate chances have been increased by 10x. Even though Blizzard increased the chances, they were still a joke.
Default drop rates and New drop rate spreadsheet/charts are included in the zip.
Don't be fooled, 10x isn't much compared to the actual percentages..

(Before) Zod: .0193%
(After) Zod: .1931%

- The amount of Cows in the Moo Moo Farm has been increased by 2x.

- Bosses, Mini-Bosses, and Cows drop rates have been increased by 3x.

- Countess can now drop up to a Zod
Note, Countess's drop rate has a 50/50 chance of either dropping an item and or a rune. If she decides to drop a rune, the normal rune calculations apply.

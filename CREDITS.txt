Credits to PhrozenKeep for having a wonderful community filled with knowledge
and resources. Without them none of this would be possible. I would like to acknowledge
specific people in the PhrozenKeep community:

- Credits to Nefarius since I used his 1.10f "Shield Block Fix" DLL to find what I
  needed to look for when updating it to 1.13d.
  
- Credits to kidpaddle94 for providing 1.13c assembly for the following:
  > Classic Whirlwind
  > Hyperjoin
  
I just looked at their work, and found the new values for 1.13d.

Credits are also given to Thyiad from the Diablo IncGamers Community for
her kindness and support.

Credits to Pharphis for advice and feedback on several decisions I was planning to make.

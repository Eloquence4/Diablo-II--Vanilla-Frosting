VERSION: 1.13d

CODE:

0001401C   6A 0A            PUSH 0A
0001401E   6A 04            PUSH 4
00014020   50               PUSH EAX
00014021   E8 F464FFFF      CALL 0000A51A
00014026   85C0             TEST EAX,EAX
00014028   0F85 9C000000    JNZ 000140CA

WHAT TO DO:
Change 85C0 to 33CO (TEST -> XOR)

HOW TO FIND THE OFFSET:

Load up the DLL by File -> Open (Not: View -> File). This will load up the other required Blizzard dlls 
so make sure all the dlls are in the same directory as D2Game.dll.

Press Ctrl + S to search for a sequence of commands (Code Block), and search for: 

PUSH 0A
PUSH 4
PUSH EAX
CALL const
TEST EAX,EAX
JNZ const

There will be two instances of this, So after you encounter the first one, just search for the same sequence again (CTRL + L), and you will be at the correct location.
Once you find that, just look at the offset for TEST EAX,EAX and you are done.

TESTEAX ADDRESS - BASE ADDRESS = NEW OFFSET
6FC34026 - 6FC20000 = 14026

You can find the base address of D2Game.dll by pressing the E at the top of OllyDbg, and looking at the BASE column for D2Game.dll in the "Executable Modules" window.

OR

You can just select the lines that you found on the screen, right clicking them, and Copy To Executable -> Selection. 
This will open a new window as if it was opened by (View -> File), and it will be at the Offset address.

1.13d Offset: 14026
1.13c Offset: 67508

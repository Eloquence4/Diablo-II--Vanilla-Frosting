Vanilla Frosting 3.9F for 1.13C by FearedBliss
Released on Thursday, July 28th, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

Overall Features:
-----------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
* Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player.

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- You can now downgrade a rune by placing the rune + antidote -> previous rune.

- All cube recipes are now completely unlocked (including tempered recipes).

- All uniques are now enabled and available on non-ladder.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style which means that they are the same size as normal. Small and comfortable.

- Changed cows level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher iLvl drops.

- Shared Party Experience: You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens (like pre 1.10)

- The number of players in a game decreased from 8 to 4 like Diablo 1 and Diablo 3. Select your members wisely.

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II

- All skills can now be used either on the left or right hand (Auras don't work on the left hand)

- You can now find Essenses in all difficulties (For Respec/Token of Absolution - Andy, Meph, Diablo, Baal)

- Countess can now drop up to a Zod
Note, Countess's drop rate has a 50/50 chance of either dropping an item and or a rune. If she decides to drop a rune, the normal rune calculations apply.

- Completely new experience table based off tenth level small exponential increases, closer to a linear scheme.
* Meaning if normal D2 experience curve was 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, it's now 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.

- The maximum level is now 100.

- Gold will no longer drop. Most people probably pick up items and sell them rather than pick up 1 or 2 pieces of gold.

- You can now redo the Cow Level even if you kill the king.

- You can now use Teleport, Thunder Storm, Battle Orders, Battle Command, and Shout in town.

- The game is geared towards higher resistances rather than immunities. Max resistance for normal monster = 99. SuperUniques can go over.

- Drop rates for the entire game have been re-done and improved. 

- The recipe to make the Cow Level is now just a Tome of Town Portal.

- Throwing weapons stack size have been increased by 5x.

- Skill timers have been removed.

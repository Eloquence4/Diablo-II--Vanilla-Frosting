Vanilla Frosting 3.0F for 1.13C by FearedBliss
Released on Wednesday, July 13th, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

Overall Features:
-----------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
* Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player & TCP/IP

- Immunities are removed from the game, the difficulty retains their normal resistances, but resistances are capped at 75%.
* Permits you to actually be able to solo Hell without HAVING to make dual builds. 
* Lets you experiment with other build styles.
* Puts the monsters and you at an even playing field.
* Pets also have a maximum of 75% unless you increase it somehow. Fire Golem normally has 100% resistance, now it only has 75%, etc.

- Fire/Cold/Light/Poison/Stoneskin enchanments are removed from the game. This is to prevent monsters from becoming immuned with the 50% to target resist that the enchantments provide.

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- You can now downgrade a rune by placing the rune + antidote -> previous rune.

- All cube recipes are now completely unlocked (including tempered recipes).

- All uniques are now enabled and available on non-ladder.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style which means that they are the same size as normal. Small and comfortable.

- Changed cows level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher iLvl drops.
* The 1.10+ cows already gave you more experience than 1.09 cows, so me increasing the level requirement, will actually give you 9785 more experience per kill. 

- You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens (like pre 1.10)

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II for SP & TCP/IP purposes ONLY

- Per rune drop rate has been increased by 10x. Even though Blizzard increased the chances, they were still a joke.
* Don't be fooled, 10x isn't much compared to the actual percentages...

(Before) Zod: .0193%
(After) Zod: .1931%

- The amount of Cows in the Moo Moo Farm has been increased by 2x.

- Drop rates for the entire game have been re-done and improved. 
* This doesn't mean you are going to find better item quality types (unique, set, rare, magic). It just means you have a better chance to a better item than junk.
* The new drop rates also encourage players to kill regular monsters, and open chests more often to find items. A player shouldn't be forced to MF in order to find items. The items will also help you along your adventure.

- All skills can now be used either on the left or right hand.

- You can now find Essenses in all difficulties (For Respec/Token of Absolution - Andy, Meph, Diablo, Baal)

- Difficulty penalties are now removed (Resistance, Exp, Life/Mana, Static Field)

- Countess can now drop up to a Zod
Note, Countess's drop rate has a 50/50 chance of either dropping an item and or a rune. If she decides to drop a rune, the normal rune calculations apply.

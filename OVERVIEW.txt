-----------------------------------------------

Overall Features:
-----------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- You can now downgrade a rune by placing the rune + antidote -> previous rune.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style; which means that they are the same size as the normal difficulty. Small and comfortable.

- Changed Hell Bovine (Cows) Monster Level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher Item Level drops.

- The number of players in a game decreased from 8 to 4 like Diablo 1 and Diablo 3. Select your members wisely.

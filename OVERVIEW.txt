Vanilla Frosting 4.1 for 1.13c by FearedBliss
Released on Friday, August 5th, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

Overall Features:
-----------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
* Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- The maximum level is now 100.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player.

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- You can now downgrade a rune by placing the rune + antidote -> previous rune.

- All cube recipes are now completely unlocked (including tempered recipes).

- All uniques are now enabled and available on non-ladder.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style which means that they are the same size as normal. Small and comfortable.

- Changed cows level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher iLvl drops.

- Shared Party Experience: You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens (pre-1.10)

- The number of players in a game decreased from 8 to 4 like Diablo 1 and Diablo 3. Select your members wisely.

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II

- All skills can now be used either on the left or right hand (Auras don't work on the left hand)

- Token of Absolution is now sold at Akara (Essenses have been removed)

- Countess can now drop up to a Zod

- You can now redo the Cow Level even if you kill the king.

- You can now use Teleport, Thunder Storm, Battle Orders, Battle Command, and Shout in town.

- The game is geared towards higher resistances rather than immunities. Max resistance for normal monster = 99. SuperUniques can go over.
* Some monster modifiers have been removed to prevent immunities.

- Drop rates and ratios for the entire game have been improved. 

- The recipe to make the Cow Level is now just a Tome of Town Portal.

- Throwing weapons stack size have been increased by 5x.

- Skill timers have been removed (pre-1.07).

D2 Enhanced 2.6b for 1.13 by FearedBliss

Put the data folder in the root of your Diablo II folder.

Add:

-direct -txt 

to the end of your parameters list.

Enjoy.

---- 2.6b ----
Major:
- Fixed a critical bug in the MonStats.txt file which might have affected resistances, but also other values. This caused the game to crash in Act 4 Hell Forge.

Minor:
- Fixed recipe names for downgrades

---- 2.5b ----
- Immunities in all difficulties are now the same as normal.

---- 2.1b ----
- Fixed some rune recipes from r10 - r18 that weren't working

---- 2.0b ----
Changes:
- Changed cows level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find better drops.
The 1.10+ cows already gave you more experience than 1.09 cows, so me increasing the level requirement, will actually give you 9785 more experience per kill. 
The only reason I can see from the slowing down of hell cows for leveling in 1.10+ is that the exp ratio was nerfed.

- Did not increase experience of baal because you are already getting more experience of baal in 1.13 then in 1.09.
Notes after checking baal in vanilla 1.09 and vanilla 1.13:

Level: 60/75/95

1.09
297964 exp normal
303809 exp night
777763 exp hell

1.13

Level: 60/75/99
216862 exp normal
1619522 exp night
4536276 exp hell

216862-29794 = -81102 less experience in normal 1.13 baal
1619522-303809 = 1315713 more experience in nightmare 1.13 baal
4536276-777763 = 3758513 more experience in hell 1.13 baal

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- Added 32 new recipes which are used for downgrading runes.
1x Rune + Antidote* = 1x Previous Rune

*The antidote is used as a security check so you don't by mistake click the transmute button with a single rune in the cube, and downgrade it.

- All recipes are now unlocked for non-ladder players as well. (Doesn't really affect anyone since this is for SP & TCP/IP.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to 1.07 style which means that they are the same size as normal. Small and comfortable.

- 4x amount of cows in the Moo Moo Farm in all difficulties (Too much? ;D)

---- 1.5b ----
Changes:
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Immunities have been re-added to the game but the maximum immunity percentage is now 100%.
Meaning that if the monster is immune to something, it will still be immune, but you can actually break the immunity.

- Changed rune colors according to their rarerity.
Common: Orange (Default)
Semi-rare: Yellow (rare)
Rare: Gold (Unique)

- Removed gem requirements in rune recipes.
If 3x rune + 1x gem = next rune, now it's 3x rune = next rune.

- Starting from Thul, you only need 2x rune to make the next rune.

...
3x Ort -> 1x Thul
2x Thul -> 1x Amn
2x Amn -> 1x Sol
...

---- 1.0b ----
Changes:

Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player & TCP/IP

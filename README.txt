---- 1.5b ----
Changes:
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Immunities have been re-added to the game but the maximum immunity percentage is now 100%.
Meaning that if the monster is immune to something, it will still be immune, but you can actually break the immunity.

- Changed rune colors according to their rarerity.
Common: Orange (Default)
Semi-rare: Yellow (rare)
Rare: Gold (Unique)

- Removed gem requirements in rune recipes.
If 3x rune + 1x gem = next rune, now it's 3x rune = next rune.

- Starting from Thul, you only need 2x rune to make the next rune.

...
3x Ort -> 1x Thul
2x Thul -> 1x Amn
2x Amn -> 1x Sol
...

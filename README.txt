Changes/Enhancements to Vanilla Diablo II 1.13C:
------------------------------------------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player & TCP/IP

- Immunities in all difficulties are now the same as Normal.
This permits people to actually be able to solo Hell without HAVING to make horrible dual builds. This also lets you experiment with other build styles as well.

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- All recipes are now unlocked for non-ladder players as well. (Doesn't really affect anyone since this is for SP & TCP/IP.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style which means that they are the same size as normal. Small and comfortable.

- Changed cows level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher iLvl drops.
The 1.10+ cows already gave you more experience than 1.09 cows, so me increasing the level requirement, will actually give you 9785 more experience per kill. 
The only reason I can see from the slowing down of hell cows for leveling in 1.10+ is that the exp ratio was nerfed.

- Did not increase experience of baal because you are already getting more experience of baal in 1.13 then in 1.09.
Notes after checking baal in vanilla 1.09 and vanilla 1.13:

Level: 60/75/95

1.09
297964 exp normal
303809 exp night
777763 exp hell

1.13

Level: 60/75/99
216862 exp normal
1619522 exp night
4536276 exp hell

216862-29794 = -81102 less experience in normal 1.13 baal
1619522-303809 = 1315713 more experience in nightmare 1.13 baal
4536276-777763 = 3758513 more experience in hell 1.13 baal

- You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens (like pre 1.10)

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II for Single Player - TCP/IP purposes ONLY

- Rune drop rate chances have been increased by 10x. Even though Blizzard increased the chances, they were still a joke.
Default drop rates and New drop rate spreadsheet/charts are included in the zip.
Don't be fooled, 10x isn't much compared to the actual percentages..

(Before) Zod: .0193%
(After) Zod: .1931%

- The amount of Cows in the Moo Moo Farm has been increased by 2x.

- Bosses, Mini-Bosses, and Cows drop rates have been increased by 3x.
A table has been included so you can see all the calculations and percentages. You can also edit the spreadsheet to find different rates at different values.

The game organizes items into different piles. Like Junk pile, Good Pile, etc. Note, that there are also more calculations involved than these raw values.

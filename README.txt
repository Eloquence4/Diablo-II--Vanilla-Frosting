Released on Tuesday, July 12th, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

Installation:
-------------
Make sure to backup your current Diablo II directory before installing. A simple copy/paste of your current Diablo II folder will do.

Extract the files to the root of your Diablo II folder, replacing any existing files.

Add:

-direct -txt 

to the end of your parameters list.

Enjoy.

Uninstallation:
Delete your Diablo II folder, and rename your old backup copy of Diablo II to 'Diablo II'.

Remove -direct -txt from the end of your parameters list.

2.5F Changes:
-------------
- Fixed the super unique immunity bug. Some super uniques still had immunities when spawning with FE/CE/LE/MR/Physical Resistance (Stoneskin). These modifiers have now been disabled from the game.
- Continued to improve and balance drop rates through out the entire game
- You can now find Essenses in all difficulties (For Respec/Token of Absolution - Andy, Meph, Diablo, Baal)

2.01F Changes:
--------------
- All skills can now be used either on left or right hand.

2.00F Changes:
--------------
- All cube recipes are now completely unlocked (including tempered recipes).

- Rune downgrade recipes have been removed.

- All uniques are now enabled and available on non-ladder (Doesn't really affect Single Player/TCP-IP since you already have them)

- Difficulty penalties are now removed (Resistance, Exp, Life/Mana, Static Field)

- Drop rates for the entire game have been re-done and improved. 
This doesn't mean you are going to find better item quality types (unique,set,rare,magic). It just means you have a better chance to a better item than junk.
The new drop rates also encourage players to kill regular monsters, and open chests more often to find items. A player shouldn't be forced to MF in order to find items. The items will also help you along your adventure.

- Resistances for each difficulty has been set back to their respective values, but the maximum resistance in the game is now 75%. This puts the monsters and the characters at an even playing field.
Also note, that your pets also have a maximum of 75% unless you increase it somehow. Fire Golem normally has 100% resistance, now it only has 75%, etc.

Changes/Enhancements to Vanilla Diablo II 1.13C - 1.00F:
------------------------------------------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player & TCP/IP

- Immunities in all difficulties are now the same as Normal.
This permits people to actually be able to solo Hell without HAVING to make horrible dual builds. This also lets you experiment with other build styles as well.

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- All recipes are now unlocked for non-ladder players as well. (Doesn't really affect anyone since this is for SP & TCP/IP.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style which means that they are the same size as normal. Small and comfortable.

- Changed cows level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher iLvl drops.
The 1.10+ cows already gave you more experience than 1.09 cows, so me increasing the level requirement, will actually give you 9785 more experience per kill. 
The only reason I can see from the slowing down of hell cows for leveling in 1.10+ is that the exp ratio was nerfed.

- You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens (like pre 1.10)

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II for Single Player - TCP/IP purposes ONLY

- Rune drop rate chances have been increased by 10x. Even though Blizzard increased the chances, they were still a joke.
Default drop rates and New drop rate spreadsheet/charts are included in the zip.
Don't be fooled, 10x isn't much compared to the actual percentages..

(Before) Zod: .0193%
(After) Zod: .1931%

- The amount of Cows in the Moo Moo Farm has been increased by 2x.

- Bosses, Mini-Bosses, and Cows drop rates have been increased by 3x.

- Countess can now drop up to a Zod
Note, Countess's drop rate has a 50/50 chance of either dropping an item and or a rune. If she decides to drop a rune, the normal rune calculations apply.

Vanilla Frosting 4.6.0 for 1.13d 
By Jonathan Vasquez (FearedBliss)
Released on Saturday, March 2, 2013
-----------------------------------------------

Features:
-----------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
	* Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- The number of players in a game decreased from 8 to 4 like Diablo 1 and Diablo 3. Select your members wisely.
	* This includes the /players command as well.

- Experience received from killing monsters has been doubled.
	* This also helps balance out the drop from 8 players to 4 players.
	* As a consequence but possibly a good thing, is that since you can't do /players 8 anymore, 
	  the maximum amount of % added to monsters HP/AR/etc is /players 4.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style; which means that they are the same size as the normal difficulty. Small and comfortable.
	
- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II.

- Shared Party Experience: You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens (pre-1.10).

- The recipe to make the Cow Level is now just a Tome of Town Portal.

- Changed Hell Bovine (Cows) Monster Level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher Item Level drops.

- You can now redo the Cow Level even if you kill the king.

- Lysander now sells TP/ID Books & Scrolls.

- Smith now has proper nightmare loot table
	* There was a typo that Blizzard had in regular D2. This has now been fixed in this patch.

-----------------------------------------------

Installation:
-------------
Make sure to backup your current Diablo II directory before installing. 
A simple copy/paste of your current Diablo II folder will do.

Extract the files to the root of your Diablo II folder, replacing any existing 
files. 

-> You specifically only need to copy and replace:

- Patch_D2.mpq
- D2Game.dll
- D2Gfx.dll

* Only copy the D2Client.dll if you had a previous version of Vanilla Frosting.
	* The D2Client.dll included in this release is just a stock D2Client.dll.

Enjoy.

Uninstallation:
Delete your Diablo II folder, and rename your old backup copy of Diablo II 
to 'Diablo II'.
